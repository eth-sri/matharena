instruction: "You are solving a problem from Project Euler. \nAs a tool you can use,\
  \ you are given access to a code execution environment. Invoke that tool to execute\
  \ Python or C++ code. You can execute code up to 20 times, so you can use them quite\
  \ liberally.\nYou can also use the tool to run code that helps you reason about\
  \ the problem, but does not directly compute the final answer.\nAnswers that consist\
  \ of code are not accepted, I will only accept a final answer to the question that\
  \ does not require me to run any code you produce, as you should use the tool for\
  \ this.\nYou are REQUIRED to use the tool to compute the final answer. It is impossible\
  \ to solve this problem without using the tool. \nInstead, your code should compute\
  \ the answer (via the tool), after which you should put your final answer within\
  \ \\boxed{{}}.\nYour answer should be correctly formatted by putting your final\
  \ answer within \\boxed{{}}, i.e., end your reply with \"### Final answer: \\\\\
  boxed{{your_answer_here}}\".\n"
